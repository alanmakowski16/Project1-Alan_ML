# Project1-Alan_ML
This project is a complete data science workflow to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year, based on 1994 US Census data.  The primary goal is to optimize for the **F1-Macro score** due to the significant class imbalance in the dataset.
